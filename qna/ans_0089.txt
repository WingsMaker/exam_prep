Correct Answer
C. Use the Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm on the single time series consisting of the full year of data with a predictor_type of regressor.
Explanation
The Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm is most likely to provide the best results in this scenario. The task is to forecast air quality based on historical data, which is a regression problem. The Linear Learner algorithm is designed for regression tasks and can effectively learn patterns and make predictions based on the given time series data. Using a regressor predictor_type will allow the algorithm to accurately forecast the air quality in parts per million of contaminants for the next 2 days. The other options, such as k-Nearest-Neighbors and Random Cut Forest, may not be as suitable for this specific task.
