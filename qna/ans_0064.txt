Answers : C

A. NO - We don't place a S3 bucket in a VPC, it is always in AWS Service Account

B. NO - without an S3 VPC endpoint, traffic will go through the Internet

C. YES - We must use the VPC endpoint (either Gateway Endpoint or Interface Endpoint)to comply with this requirement "Data communication traffic must stay within the AWS network".

D. NO - we need endpoints for both SageMaker and S3 to avoid Internet traffic

VPC endpoint and NAT gateway are similar, but NAT gateway is for giving resources in the VPC the chance to initiate connections with the internet, whereas a VPC endpoint only allows it to go to other AWS services.
