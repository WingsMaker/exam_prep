A social networking organization wants to analyze all the comments and likes from its users to flag offensive language on the site. The organization's data science team wants to use a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architecture to classify the raw sentences from the comments into one of two categories: offensive and
nonoffensive. What should the team do to prepare the data for the LSTM?

A.
Convert the individual sentences into sequences of words. Use those as the input.

B.
Convert the individual sentences into numerical sequences starting from the number 1  for each word in a sentence. Use the sentences as the input.

C.
Vectorize the sentences. Transform them into numerical sequences. Use the sentences as the input.

D.
Vectorize the sentences. Transform them into numerical sequences with a padding. Use the sentences as the input.
