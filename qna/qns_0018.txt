A Data Scientist is developing a machine learning model to classify whether a financial transaction is fraudulent. The labeled data available for training consists of 100000 non-fraudulent observations and 1000 fraudulent observations.
The Data Scientist applies the XGBoost algorithm to the data, resulting in the following confusion matrix when the trained model is applied to a previously unseen validation dataset. The accuracy of the model is 99.1%, but the Data Scientist has been asked to reduce the number of false negatives.

Predicted                0       1
Actual         0  99,966    34
                      1        877  123

Which combination of steps should the Data Scientist take to reduce the number of false negative predictions by the model? (Select TWO.)

A. Change the XGBoost eval_metric parameter to optimize based on rmse instead of error.

B. Increase the XGBoost scale_pos_weight parameter to adjust the balance of positive and negative weights.

C. Increase the XGBoost max_depth parameter because the model is currently underfitting the data.

D. Change the XGBoost eval_metric parameter to optimize based on AUC instead of error.

E. Decrease the XGBoost max_depth parameter because the model is currently overfitting the data.
