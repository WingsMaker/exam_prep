A Machine Learning Specialist is attempting to build a Linear Regression model. Given the displayed residual plot only, what is the MOST likely problem with the model?

[A] Linear Regression is inappropriate. The residuals do not have constant variance.
[B] Linear Regression is inappropriate. The underlying data has outliers.
[C] Linear Regression is appropriate. The residuals have a zero mean.
[D] Linear Regression is appropriate. The residuals have constant variance.
