A media company with a very large archive of unlabeled images, text, audio, and video footage wishes to index its assets to allow rapid identification of relevant content by the Research team. 
The company wants to use machine learning to accelerate the efforts of its in-house researchers who have limited machine learning expertise. 
Which is the FASTEST route to index the assets?

A. Use Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Transcribe to tag data into distinct categories/classes.

B. Create a set of Amazon Mechanical Turk Human Intelligence Tasks to label all footage.

C. Use Amazon Transcribe to convert speech to text. Use the Amazon SageMaker Neural Topic Model (NTM) and Object Detection algorithms to tag data into distinct categories/classes.

D. Use the AWS Deep Learning AMI and Amazon EC2 GPU instances to create custom models for audio transcription and topic modeling, and use object detection to tag data into distinct categories/classes.
