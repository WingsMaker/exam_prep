A Machine Learning Specialist at a company sensitive to security is preparing a dataset for model training. The dataset is stored in Amazon S3 and contains Personally Identifiable Information (Pll). The dataset:
* Must be accessible from a VPC only.
* Must not traverse the public internet. How can these requirements be satisfied?

A. Create a VPC endpoint and apply a bucket access policy that restricts access to the given VPC endpoint and the VPC.

B. Create a VPC endpoint and apply a bucket access policy that allows access from the given VPC endpoint and an Amazon EC2 instance.

C. Create a VPC endpoint and use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to allow traffic between only the given VPC endpoint and an Amazon EC2 instance.

D. Create a VPC endpoint and use security groups to restrict access to the given VPC endpoint and an Amazon EC2 instance.
