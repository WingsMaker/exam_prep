A machine learning (ML) specialist wants to secure calls to the Amazon SageMaker Service API. The specialist has configured Amazon VPC with a VPC interface endpoint for the Amazon SageMaker Service API and is attempting to secure traffic from specific sets of instances and IAM users. The VPC is configured with a single public subnet. Which combination of steps should the ML specialist take to secure the traffic?
(Choose two.)

[A] Add a VPC endpoint policy to allow access to the IAM users.
[B] Modify the users' IAM policy to allow access to Amazon SageMaker Service API calls only.
[C] Modify the security group on the endpoint network interface to restrict access to the instances.
[D] Modify the ACL on the endpoint network interface to restrict access to the instances.
[E] Add a SageMaker Runtime VPC endpoint interface to the VPC.
