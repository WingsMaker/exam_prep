A Machine Learning Specialist built an image classification deep learning model. However the Specialist ran into an overfitting problem in which the training and testing accuracies were 99% and 75%r respectively.
How should the Specialist address this issue and what is the reason behind it?

A. The learning rate should be increased because the optimization process was trapped at a local minimum.

B. The dropout rate at the flatten layer should be increased because the model is not generalized enough.

C. The dimensionality of dense layer next to the flatten layer should be increased because the model is not complex enough.

D. The epoch number should be increased because the optimization process was terminated before it reached the global minimum.
