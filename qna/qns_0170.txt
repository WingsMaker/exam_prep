A Machine Learning Specialist is required to build a supervised image-recognition model to identify a cat. The ML Specialist performs some tests and records the following results for a neural network-based image classifier. Total number of images available = 1,000 Test set images = 100 (constant test set). The ML Specialist notices that, in over 75% of the misclassified images, the cats were held upside down by their owners. Which techniques can be used by the ML Specialist to improve this specific test error?

[A] Increase the training data by adding variation in rotation for training images.
[B] Increase the number of epochs for model training.
[C] Increase the number of layers for the neural network.
[D] Increase the dropout rate for the second-to-last layer.
