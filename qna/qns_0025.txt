This graph shows the training and validation loss against the epochs for a neural network The network being trained is as follows
.  Two dense layers one output neuron
.  100 neurons in each layer
.  100 epochs
.  Random initialization of weights
Which technique can be used to improve model performance in terms of accuracy in the validation set?

A. Early stopping

B. Random initialization of weights with appropriate seed

C. Increasing the number of epochs

D. Adding another layer with the 100 neurons
