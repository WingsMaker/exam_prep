Correct Answer
B. Use AWS Glue to catalogue the data and Amazon Athena to run queries.
Explanation
The correct answer is to use AWS Glue to catalogue the data and Amazon Athena to run queries. AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics. It can automatically discover and catalog data stored in Amazon S3, making it easier to query the data using SQL. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that allows you to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. This combination of AWS Glue and Amazon Athena requires the least effort as it eliminates the need for manual data transformation and provides a simple and efficient way to query the data.
