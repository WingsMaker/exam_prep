Answers : B

Explaination
AWS CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls made on the account. 
The Machine Learning team can use AWS CloudTrail to log Amazon SageMaker API calls to Amazon S3. 
They can then use CloudWatch to create alarms and receive notifications when the model is overfitting.

To ensure auditors can view the Amazon SageMaker log activity report, the team can add code to push a custom metric to Amazon CloudWatch. This provides a single place to view and analyze logs across all the services and resources in the environment.

CloudTrail logs captured in S3 without any code/lambda
The custom metrics can be published to Cloudwatch...test for overfit on MXNET...which will set off an alarm...which can then be subscribed on SNS

What does this line do?
	"Add code to push a custom metric to Amazon CloudWatch"
It creates a metric for overfitting (accuracy of training data and accuracy of test data).
