Explanation:

The SageMaker Spark library is a library that enables Apache Spark applications to integrate with Amazon SageMaker for training and hosting machine learning models.

The library provides several features, such as:

Estimators: Classes that allow Spark users to train Amazon SageMaker models and host them on Amazon SageMaker endpoints using the Spark MLlib Pipelines API. 
The library supports various built-in algorithms, such as linear learner, XGBoost, K-means, etc., as well as custom algorithms using Docker containers.

Model classes: Classes that wrap Amazon SageMaker models in a Spark MLlib Model abstraction. 
This allows Spark users to use Amazon SageMaker endpoints for inference within Spark applications. 
Data sources: Classes that allow Spark users to read data from Amazon S3 using the Spark Data Sources API. The library supports various data formats, such as CSV, LibSVM, RecordIO, etc.

To integrate the Spark application with SageMaker, the Machine Learning Specialist should do the following:

Install the SageMaker Spark library in the Spark environment. 
This can be done by using Maven, pip, or downloading the JAR file from GitHub.

Use the appropriate estimator from the SageMaker Spark Library to train a model.
