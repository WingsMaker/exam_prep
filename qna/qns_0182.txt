A machine learning specialist is running an Amazon SageMaker endpoint using the built-in object detection algorithm on a P3 instance for real-time predictions in a company's production application. 
When evaluating the model's resource utilization, the specialist notices that the model is using only a fraction of the GPU. 
Which architecture changes would ensure that provisioned resources are being utilized effectively?

A. Redeploy the model as a batch transform job on an M5 instance.

B. Redeploy the model on an M5 instance. Attach Amazon Elastic Inference to the instance.

C. Redeploy the model on a P3dn instance.

D. Deploy the model onto an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster using a P3 instance.
