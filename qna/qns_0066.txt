A Machine Learning Specialist is developing recommendation engine for a photography blog Given a picture, the recommendation engine should show a picture that captures similar objects. The Specialist would like to create a numerical representation feature to perform nearest-neighbor searches What actions would allow the Specialist to get relevant numerical representations?

A. Reduce image resolution and use reduced resolution pixel values as features

B. Use Amazon Mechanical Turk to label image content and create a one-hot representation indicating the presence of specific labels

C. Run images through a neural network pie-trained on ImageNet, and collect the feature vectors from the penultimate layer

D. Average colors by channel to obtain three-dimensional representations of images.
