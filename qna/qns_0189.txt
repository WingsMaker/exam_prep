A company is using Amazon Textract to extract textual data from thousands of scanned text-heavy legal documents daily. The company uses this information to process loan applications automatically. Some of the documents fail business validation and are returned to human reviewers, who investigate the errors. This activity increases the time to process the loan applications. What should the company do to reduce the processing time of loan applications?

[A] Configure Amazon Textract to route low-confidence predictions to Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Perform a manual review on those words before performing a business validation.
[B] Use an Amazon Textract synchronous operation instead of an asynchronous operation.
[C] Configure Amazon Textract to route low-confidence predictions to Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I). Perform a manual review on those words before performing a business validation.
[D] Use Amazon Rekognition's feature to detect text in an image to extract the data from scanned images. Use this information to process the loan applications.
