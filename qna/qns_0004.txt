A data scientist is evaluating different binary classification models. A false positive result is 5 times more expensive (from a business perspective) than a false negative result.
The models should be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1) Must have a recall rate of at least 80%
2) Must have a false positive rate of 10% or less
3) Must minimize business costs
After creating each binary classification model, the data scientist generates the corresponding confusion
matrix.
Which confusion matrix represents the model that satisfies the requirements?

A) TN = 91, FP = 9, FN = 22, TP = 78

B) TN = 99, FP = 1, FN = 21, TP = 79

C) TN = 96, FP = 4, FN = 10, TP = 90

D) TN = 98, FP = 2, FN = 18, TP = 82
