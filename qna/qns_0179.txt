An e commerce company wants to launch a new cloud-based product recommendation feature for its web application. Due to data localization regulations, any sensitive data must not leave its on-premises data center, and the product recommendation model must be trained and tested using nonsensitive data only. Data transfer to the cloud must use IPsec. The web application is hosted on premises with a PostgreSQL database that contains all the data. The company wants the data to be uploaded securely to Amazon S3 each day for model retraining. How should a machine learning specialist meet these requirements?

[A] Create an AWS Glue job to connect to the PostgreSQL DB instance. Ingest tables without sensitive data through an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection directly into Amazon S3.
[B] Create an AWS Glue job to connect to the PostgreSQL DB instance. Ingest all data through an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection into Amazon S3 while removing sensitive data using a PySpark job.
[C] Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with table mapping to select PostgreSQL tables with no sensitive data through an SSL connection. Replicate data directly into Amazon S3.
[D] Use PostgreSQL logical replication to replicate all data to PostgreSQL in Amazon EC2 through AWS Direct Connect with a VPN connection. Use AWS Glue to move data from Amazon EC2 to Amazon S3.
