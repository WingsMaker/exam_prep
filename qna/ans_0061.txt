Answers : C,D

Option A is not possible because the built-in image classification algorithm cannot be customized. 
Option B is not feasible because it is not possible to change the default image classification algorithm through a support case. 
Option E is also not a recommended approach because it involves manually installing software on an EC2 instance rather than using the managed services provided by SageMaker.
