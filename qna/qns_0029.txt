A Machine Learning Specialist has built a model using Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms and is not getting expected accurate results The Specialist wants to use hyperparameter optimization to increase the model's accuracy
Which method is the MOST repeatable and requires the LEAST amount of effort to achieve this?

A. Launch multiple training jobs in parallel with different hyperparameters

B. Create an AWS Step Functions workflow that monitors the accuracy in Amazon CloudWatch Logs and relaunches the training job with a defined list of hyperparameters

C. Create a hyperparameter tuning job and set the accuracy as an objective metric.

D. Create a random walk in the parameter space to iterate through a range of values that should be used for each individual hyperparameter
