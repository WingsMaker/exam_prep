A machine learning specialist works for a fruit processing company and needs to build a system that categorizes apples into three types. 
The specialist has collected a dataset that contains 150 images for each type of apple and applied transfer learning on a neural network that was pretrained on ImageNet with this dataset. 
The company requires at least 85% accuracy to make use of the model. 
After an exhaustive grid search, the optimal hyperparameters produced the following: 68% accuracy on the training set. 
67% accuracy on the validation set. 
What can the machine learning specialist do to improve the system's accuracy?

A. Upload the model to an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance and use the Amazon SageMaker HPO feature to optimize the model's hyperparameters.

B. Add more data to the training set and retrain the model using transfer learning to reduce the bias.

C. Use a neural network model with more layers that are pretrained on ImageNet and apply transfer learning to increase the variance.

D. Train a new model using the current neural network architecture.
