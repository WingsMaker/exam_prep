A Data Scientist created a correlation matrix between nine variables and the target variable. The correlation coefficient between two of the numerical variables, variable 1 and variable 5, is -0.95. How should the Data Scientist interpret the correlation coefficient?

A. As variable 1 increases, variable 5 increases

B. As variable 1 increases, variable 5 decreases

C. Variable 1 does not have any influence on variable 5

D. The data is not sufficient to make a well-informed interpretation
