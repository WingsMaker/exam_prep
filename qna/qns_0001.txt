A machine learning team has several large CSV datasets in Amazon S3. Historically, models built with the Amazon SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm have taken hours to train on similar-sized datasets. The team's leaders need to accelerate the training process.
What can a machine learning specialist do to address this concern?

A) Use Amazon SageMaker Pipe mode.

B) Use Amazon Machine Learning to train the models.

C) Use Amazon Kinesis to stream the data to Amazon SageMaker.

D) Use AWS Glue to transform the CSV dataset to the JSON format.
