A Machine Learning Specialist observes several performance problems with the training portion of a machine learning solution on Amazon SageMaker The solution uses a large training dataset 2 TB in size and is using the SageMaker k-means algorithm The observed issues include the unacceptable length of time it takes before the training job launches and poor I/O throughput while training the model.
What should the Specialist do to address the performance issues with the current solution?

A. Use the SageMaker batch transform feature

B. Compress the training data into Apache Parquet format.

C. Ensure that the input mode for the training job is set to Pipe.

D. Copy the training dataset to an Amazon EFS volume mounted on the SageMaker instance.
