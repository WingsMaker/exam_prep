Correct Answers:
B. Install the SageMaker Spark library in the Spark environment.
C. Use the appropriate estimator from the SageMaker Spark Library to train a model.
E. Use the SageMaker Model transform method to get inferences from the model hosted in SageMaker.
Explanation
To integrate the Spark application with SageMaker, the Machine Learning Specialist would need to perform the following steps: 

1) Install the SageMaker Spark library in the Spark environment, which allows for seamless integration between Spark and SageMaker. 

2) Use the appropriate estimator from the SageMaker Spark Library to train a model, which provides a high-level API for training models on SageMaker using Spark. 

3) Use the SageMaker Model transform method to get inferences from the model hosted in SageMaker, which allows for real-time inference on new data using the trained model.
