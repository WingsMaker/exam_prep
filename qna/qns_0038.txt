A Machine Learning Specialist is using Amazon SageMaker to host a model for a highly available customer-facing application .
The Specialist has trained a new version of the model, validated it with historical data, and now wants to deploy it to production To limit any risk of a negative customer experience, the Specialist wants to be able to monitor the model and roll it back, if needed 
What is the SIMPLEST approach with the LEAST risk to deploy the model and roll it back, if needed?

A. Create a SageMaker endpoint and configuration for the new model version. Redirect production traffic to the new endpoint by updating the client configuration. Revert traffic to the last version if the model does not perform as expected.

B. Create a SageMaker endpoint and configuration for the new model version. Redirect production traffic to the new endpoint by using a load balancer Revert traffic to the last version if the model does not perform as expected.

C. Update the existing SageMaker endpoint to use a new configuration that is weighted to send 5% of the traffic to the new variant. Revert traffic to the last version by resetting the weights if the model does not perform as expected.

D. Update the existing SageMaker endpoint to use a new configuration that is weighted to send 100% of the traffic to the new variant Revert traffic to the last version by resetting the weights if the model does not perform as expected.
