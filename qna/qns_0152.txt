A health care company is planning to use neural networks to classify their X-ray images into normal and abnormal classes. 
The labeled data is divided into a training set of 1,000 images and a test set of 200 images. 
The initial training of a neural network model with 50 hidden layers yielded 99% accuracy on the training set, but only 55% accuracy on the test set. 
What changes should the Specialist consider to solve this issue?
(Choose three.)

A. Choose a higher number of layers.

B. Choose a lower number of layers.

C. Choose a smaller learning rate.

D. Enable dropout.

E. Include all the images from the test set in the training set.

F. Enable early stopping.
