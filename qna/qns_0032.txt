An Machine Learning Specialist discover the following statistics while experimenting on a model.
What can the Specialist conclude from the experiments?

Experiment 1 :
Baselin Model
Train Error = 5%
Test Error = 16%

Experiment 2 :
The Specialist added more layers and neurons to the model
and received the following results
Train Error = 5.2%
Test Error = 15.7%

Experiment 3 :
The Specialist reverted back to the original number of neurons
from experiment 1 and implemented regularization in the neural network,
which yield the following results
Train Error = 4.7%
Test Error = 9.5%

A. The model In Experiment 1 had a high variance error lhat was reduced in Experiment 3 by regularization Experiment 2 shows that there is minimal bias error in Experiment 1

B. The model in Experiment 1 had a high bias error that was reduced in Experiment 3 by regularization Experiment 2 shows that there is minimal variance error in Experiment 1

C. The model in Experiment 1 had a high bias error and a high variance error that were reduced in Experiment 3 by regularization Experiment 2 shows thai high bias cannot be reduced by increasing layers and neurons in the model

D. The model in Experiment 1 had a high random noise error that was reduced in Expenment 3 by regularization Expenment 2 shows that random noise cannot be
reduced by increasing layers and neurons in the model
