A medical imaging company wants to train a computer vision model to detect areas of concern on patients' CT scans. The company has a large collection of unlabeled CT scans that are linked to each patient and stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The scans must be accessible to authorized users only. A machine learning engineer needs to build a labeling pipeline. Which set of steps should the engineer take to build the labeling pipeline with the LEAST effort?

[A] Create a workforce with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Build a labeling tool on Amazon EC2 Queue images for labeling by using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Write the labeling instructions.
[B] Create an Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce and manifest file. Create a labeling job by using the built-in image classification task type in Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Write the labeling instructions.
[C] Create a private workforce and manifest file. Create a labeling job by using the built-in bounding box task type in Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Write the labeling instructions.
[D] Create a workforce with Amazon Cognito. Build a labeling web application with AWS Amplify. Build a labeling workflow backend using AWS Lambda. Write the labeling instructions.
