A large JSON dataset for a project has been uploaded to a private Amazon S3 bucket. The Machine Learning Specialist wants to securely access and explore the data from an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. A new VPC was created and assigned to the Specialist. How can the privacy and integrity of the data stored in Amazon S3 be
maintained while granting access to the Specialist for analysis?

A.
Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC with SageMaker-provided internet access enabled. Use an S3 ACL to open read privileges to the everyone group

B.
Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to access the data. Copy the JSON dataset from Amazon S3 into the ML storage volume on the SageMaker notebook instance and work against the local dataset.

C.
Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC and create an S3 VPC endpoint for the notebook to access the data, define a custom S3 bucket policy to only allow requests from your VPC to access the S3 bucket.

D.
Launch the SageMaker notebook instance within the VPC with SageMaker-provided internet access enabled. Generate an S3 pre-signed URL for access to data in the bucket.
