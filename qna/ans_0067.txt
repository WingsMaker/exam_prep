Answers : A

The solution that the agency should consider is option A: Use a proxy server at each local office and for each camera, and stream the RTSP feed to a unique Amazon Kinesis Video Streams video stream. On each stream, use Amazon Rekognition Video and create a stream processor to detect faces from a collection of known employees and alert when non-employees are detected.

By using a proxy server at each local office and streaming the RTSP feed to individual Amazon Kinesis Video Streams video streams, the agency can efficiently handle the large number of video cameras in different office locations. Using Amazon Rekognition Video, the agency can create a stream processor to detect faces from a collection of known employees. This allows for real-time identification of non-employees based on facial recognition. Alerts can then be generated when non-employees are detected, ensuring that the agency is able to identify and respond to potential security threats in real-time.
