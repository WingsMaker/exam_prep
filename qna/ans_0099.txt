Correct Answer
D. Launch the notebook instances in a private subnet and access the data through an S3 VPC endpoint.
Explanation
The company should launch the notebook instances in a private subnet and access the data through an S3 VPC endpoint. This setup ensures that the data is not transmitted across the internet, as required by the compliance policy. By using a private subnet, the instances are not accessible from the public internet. The S3 VPC endpoint allows the instances to securely access the S3 bucket within the VPC, without the need for internet connectivity. This ensures that the data remains within the company's network and complies with the compliance policy.
