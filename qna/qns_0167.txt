An aircraft engine manufacturing company is measuring 200 performance metrics in a time-series. 
Engineers want to detect critical manufacturing defects in near-real time during testing. 
All of the data needs to be stored for offline analysis. 
What approach would be the MOST effective to perform near-real time defect detection?

A. Use AWS IoT Analytics for ingestion, storage, and further analysis. Use Jupyter notebooks from within AWS IoT Analytics to carry out analysis for anomalies.

B. Use Amazon S3 for ingestion, storage, and further analysis. Use an Amazon EMR cluster to carry out Apache Spark ML K-means clustering to determine anomalies.

C. Use Amazon S3 for ingestion, storage, and further analysis. Use the Amazon SageMaker Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm to determine anomalies.

D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for ingestion and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics Random Cut Forest (RCF) to perform anomaly detection. Use Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon S3 for further analysis.
