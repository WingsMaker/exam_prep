A Data Engineer needs to build a model using a dataset containing customer credit card information.
How can the Data Engineer ensure the data remains encrypted and the credit card information is secure? Use a custom encryption algorithm to encrypt the data and store the data on an Amazon SageMaker instance in a VPC. Use the SageMaker DeepAR  algorithm to randomize the credit card numbers.

A. Use an IAM policy to encrypt the data on the Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon Kinesis to automatically discard credit card numbers and insert fake credit card numbers.

B. Use an Amazon SageMaker launch configuration to encrypt the data once it is copied to the SageMaker instance in a VP

C. Use the SageMaker principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the length of the credit card numbers.

D. Use AWS KMS to encrypt the data on Amazon S3
