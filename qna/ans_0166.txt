The answers : A,C.

From the questions:
1. The Marketing team wants to interpret the model and see the direct impact of relevant features on the model outcome =>  The original features who impact the target.

2. There is a wide gap between the training and validation set accuracy => Model overfitting

To resolve the two problem:
A. (Correct) Regularization could prevent overfitting
B. (Wrong) Wrong. More features, Overfitting will be worse.
C. (Correct) Chose the best feature without modifying features, eliminate the least important features(dimensionality reduction)
D. (Wrong)  Change the features space when non-linearity exist in features co-variance
E. (Wrong) Linear Discriminant Analysis could help reduce dimensionality but transform features also, you could not recognise transformed features.
