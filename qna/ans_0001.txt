A  Amazon SageMaker Pipe mode streams the data directly to the container,

Streaming can provide faster start times for training jobs and better throughput.
With Pipe mode, you also reduce the size of the Amazon EBS volumes for your training instances. 

B would not apply in this scenario. 
C is a streaming ingestion solution, but is not applicable in this scenario.
