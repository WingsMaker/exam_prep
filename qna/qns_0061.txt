A company is observing low accuracy while training on the default built-in image classification algorithm in Amazon SageMaker. The Data Science team wants to use an Inception neural network architecture instead of a ResNet architecture.
Which of the following will accomplish this? (Select TWO.)

A. Customize the built-in image classification algorithm to use Inception and use this for model training.

B. Create a support case with the SageMaker team to change the default image classification algorithm to Inception.

C. Bundle a Docker container with TensorFlow Estimator loaded with an Inception network and use this for model training.

D. Use custom code in Amazon SageMaker with TensorFlow Estimator to load the model with an Inception network and use this for model training.

E. Download and apt-get install the inception network code into an Amazon EC2 instance and use this instance as a Jupyter notebook in Amazon SageMaker.
