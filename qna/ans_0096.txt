Correct Answer
C. Change the input mode to Pipe
Explanation
Changing the input mode to Pipe would speed up the training jobs while keeping the costs low. By using Pipe mode,
the company can stream the data directly from Amazon S3 to the training instance without the need to download
the entire 100 GB data before training starts. This eliminates the time-consuming download process and allows for
faster training. Additionally, it helps in reducing storage costs as there is no need to store the data on the training
instance.
