A machine learning (ML) specialist uploads a dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket that is protected by server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). The ML specialist needs to ensure that an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance can read the dataset that is in Amazon S3. Which solution will meet these requirements?

[A] Define security groups to allow all HTTP inbound and outbound traffic. Assign the security groups to the SageMaker notebook instance.
[B] Configure the SageMaker notebook instance to have access to the VPC. Grant permission in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key policy to the notebook's VPC.
[C] Assign an IAM role that provides S3 read access for the dataset to the SageMaker notebook. Grant permission in the KMS key policy to the IAM role.
[D] Assign the same KMS key that encrypts the data in Amazon S3 to the SageMaker notebook instance.
