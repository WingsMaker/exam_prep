A web-based company wants to improve its conversion rate on its landing page Using a large historical dataset of customer visits, the company has repeatedly trained a multi-class deep learning network algorithm on Amazon SageMaker However there is an overfitting problem training data shows 90% accuracy in predictions, while test data shows 70% accuracy only
The company needs to boost the generalization of its model before deploying it into production to maximize conversions of visits to purchases
Which action is recommended to provide the HIGHEST accuracy model for the company's test and validation data?

A. Increase the randomization of training data in the mini-batches used in training.

B. Allocate a higher proportion of the overall data to the training dataset

C. Apply L1 or L2 regularization and dropouts to the training.

D. Reduce the number of layers and units (or neurons) from the deep learning network.
