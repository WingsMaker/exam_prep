A Machine Learning Specialist is configuring automatic model tuning in Amazon SageMaker
When using the hyperparameter optimization feature, which of the following guidelines should be followed to improve optimization?

Choose the maximum number of hyperparameters supported by

A. Amazon SageMaker to search the largest number of combinations possible

B. Specify a very large hyperparameter range to allow Amazon SageMaker to cover every possible value.

C. Use log-scaled hyperparameters to allow the hyperparameter space to be searched as quickly as possible

D. Execute only one hyperparameter tuning job at a time and improve tuning through successive rounds of experiments
