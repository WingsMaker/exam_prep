The Specialist must develop a machine learning approach to identify the customer shopping patterns, preferences, and trends to enhance the website-for better service and smart recommendations. Which solution should the Specialist recommend?

[A] Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for the given collection of discrete data to identify patterns in the customer database.
[B] A neural network with a minimum of three layers and random initial weights to identify patterns in the customer database.
[C] Collaborative filtering based on user interactions and correlations to identify patterns in the customer database.
[D] Random Cut Forest (RCF) over random subsamples to identify patterns in the customer database.
