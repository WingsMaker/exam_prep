The goal of classification is to determine to which class or category a data point (customer in our case) belongs to. 
For classification problems, data scientists would use historical data with predefined target variables AKA labels (churner/non-churner)  
-  answers that need to be predicted  
-  to train an algorithm. 

With classification, businesses can answer the following questions:
Will this customer churn or not?
Will a customer renew their subscription?
Will a user downgrade a pricing plan?
Are there any signs of unusual customer behavior?
