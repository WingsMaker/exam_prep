Correct Answer
B. One-hot encoding
Explanation
The technique that should be used to convert the Day-Of_Week column to binary values is one-hot encoding. Onehot encoding is a technique used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors. Each category is converted into a binary column, where a value of 1 represents the presence of that category and a value of 0 represents the absence. This is commonly used in machine learning algorithms to handle categorical data and allow them to be used in mathematical calculations.
