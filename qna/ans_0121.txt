Correct Answer
D. Apply Amazon SageMaker Object2Vec to claims in the training set. Send the derived features space as inputs for the downstream supervised task.
Explanation
Amazon SageMaker Object2Vec generalizes the Word2Vec embedding technique for words to more complex objects, such as sentences and paragraphs. Since the supervised learning task is at the level of whole claims, for which there are labels, and no labels are available at the word level, Object2Vec needs be used instead of Word2Vec.
