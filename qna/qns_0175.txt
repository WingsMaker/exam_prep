A manufacturer is operating a large number of factories with a complex supply chain relationship where unexpected downtime of a machine can cause production to stop at several factories. A data scientist wants to analyze sensor data from the factories to identify equipment in need of preemptive maintenance and then dispatch a service team to prevent unplanned downtime. The sensor readings from a single machine can include up to 200 data points including temperatures, voltages, vibrations, RPMs, and pressure readings. To collect this sensor data, the manufacturer deployed Wi-Fi and LANs across the factories. Even though many factory locations do not have reliable or high- speed internet connectivity, the manufacturer would like to maintain near-real-time inference capabilities. Which deployment architecture for the model will address these business requirements?

[A] Deploy the model in Amazon SageMaker. Run sensor data through this model to predict which machines need maintenance.
[B] Deploy the model on AWS IoT Greengrass in each factory. Run sensor data through this model to infer which machines need maintenance.
[C] Deploy the model to an Amazon SageMaker batch transformation job. Generate inferences in a daily batch report to identify machines that need maintenance.
[D] Deploy the model in Amazon SageMaker and use an IoT rule to write data to an Amazon DynamoDB table. Consume a DynamoDB stream from the table with an AWS Lambda function to invoke the endpoint.
