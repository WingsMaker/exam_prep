A company is converting a large number of unstructured paper receipts into images. 
The company wants to create a model based on natural language processing (NLP) to find relevant entities such as date, location, and notes, as well as some custom entities such as receipt numbers. 
The company is using optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text for data labeling. 
However, documents are in different structures and formats, and the company is facing challenges with setting up the manual workflows for each document type. 
Additionally, the company trained a named entity recognition (NER) model for custom entity detection using a small sample size. 
This model has a very low confidence score and will require retraining with a large dataset. 
Which solution for text extraction and entity detection will require the LEAST amount of effort?

A. Extract text from receipt images by using Amazon Textract. Use the Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm to train on the text for entities and custom entities.

B. Extract text from receipt images by using a deep learning OCR model from the AWS Marketplace. Use the NER deep learning model to extract entities.

C. Extract text from receipt images by using Amazon Textract. Use Amazon Comprehend for entity detection, and use Amazon Comprehend custom entity recognition for custom entity detection.

D. Extract text from receipt images by using a deep learning OCR model from the AWS Marketplace. Use Amazon Comprehend for entity detection, and use Amazon Comprehend custom entity recognition for custom entity detection.
